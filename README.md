# C++ Experiment 1: Hello World & Basic Calculator

## Aim
> Write a C++ program to print "Hello, World!"

> Make a simple calculator to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

## Objectives
ðŸ”¹ Learn how a C++ program starts and works

ðŸ”¹ Use 'cout' to print output and 'cin' to take input

ðŸ”¹ Know why we use 'using namespace std;'.

ðŸ”¹ Use of // to write comments in code for better understanding of code.

## Theory
#### Why C++ is better than C?
C++ is better than C because it has more useful features that make programming easier and more powerful. It supports object-oriented programming, which helps in writing clean, organized, and reusable code. C++ allows the use of classes, function overloading, and better error handling. It also has a Standard Template Library (STL) for faster coding. Overall, C++ is better for building large, complex, and user-friendly programs compared to C.

#### C++ Program Basics 
> #include <iostream>: Adds the input-output library to the code

> using namespace std;: Allows using cin and cout directly

> int main(): Starting point of every C++ program

> return 0;: Marks the end of the program successfully

> cout: Used to print/output data to the screen

> cin: Used to take input from the user

> +, -, *, /: Arithmetic operators used for calculator functions

> float: Data type used to store decimal numbers

> if-else: Used to make decisions in code (if required)

> //: Used to add comments to explain code

> Every C++ statement ends with a semicolon (;)

## Program Explanation
### Basic Operations and Terms used
> #include <iostream> tells the computer to use input and output functions

> using namespace std; lets us use cout and cin easily (no need to write std::everytime)

> int main() is the starting point of every C++ program.

> return 0; means the program implemented successfully.

> cout is used to print something on screen

> cin is used to take input from the user

> if-else(conditional statements) helps us decide what to do based on conditions (true/false)

### Program execution 
1) We use cout to print: "Hello, World!"
2) Then we make a calculator:
3) We take two numbers from the user using cin
4) We do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
5) We save each result in a variable
6) Then we print the results using cout

## What I Used
- #include â†’ to add libraries
- cin, cout â†’ to take input and give output
- +, -, *, / â†’ to do math
- float â†’ to store numbers with decimals
- // â†’ to write comments
- if-else â†’ to make decisions (if needed)
- Every statement in C++ ends with a semicolon (;)
 
## Sample Output
```
Hello World
Enter num1 :	54
Enter num_2 :	89
Sum :143
Difference :-35
Product :4806
Division :0.606742
```
